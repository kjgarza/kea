    Generate charades prompts for popular songs from the 1990s Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles.

    - Song titles that are easy to visualize (e.g., "I Will Always Love You", "Baby Got Back", "Vogue")
    - Artist names that have distinctive characteristics
    - Musical genres represented in the 1990s (R&B, pop, hip-hop, adult contemporary, rock ballads)
    - Songs with visual elements from music videos or lyrics
    - Dance moves or actions associated with songs (e.g., "Macarena", "Ice Ice Baby")

    Focus on the most iconic number-one hits from the 1990s that players would recognize and be able to act out effectively.
