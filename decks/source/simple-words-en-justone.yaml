    Generate target words for the Just One game.
    Words should be:
    - Common enough that most people know them
    - Concrete nouns work best (volcano, astronaut, treasure)
    - Not too obscure or technical
    - Easy to give one-word clues for
    - Not proper nouns (save those for Monikers)

    Good categories:
    - Nature (rainbow, jungle, volcano)
    - Professions (detective, pirate, wizard)
    - Food (chocolate, pizza, sushi)
    - Objects (treasure, diamond, rocket)
    - Concepts that are concrete (nightmare, adventure, magic)

    Avoid:
    - Abstract concepts that are hard to clue
    - Words with very limited clue options
    - Overly simple words (cat, dog, house)
