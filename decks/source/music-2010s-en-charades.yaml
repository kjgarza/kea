    Generate charades prompts for popular songs from the 2010s Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles.
    Players should act out the song title, artist name, or key elements from the song without speaking.
    Include a mix of:
    - Song titles that are easy to visualize (e.g., "Firework", "Happy", "Can't Feel My Face")
    - Artist names that have distinctive characteristics
    - Musical genres represented in the 2010s (pop, hip-hop, dance, R&B, country, etc.)
    - Songs with visual elements from music videos or lyrics
    - Dance moves or actions associated with songs

    Focus on the most iconic number-one hits that players would recognize and be able to act out effectively.
    Songs should have clear visual or physical representations that can be acted out in charades.
